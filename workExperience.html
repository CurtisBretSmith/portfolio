                        My internship at Hewlett Packard Enterprise was an amazing learning experience. I received hands
                        on experience with industry leading hardware and software. This experience taught me how to
                        install, configure, and troubleshoot network switches, servers, and storage systems. In addition
                        to the day to day data center operations, I was also allowed to assist the instructors with
                        content delivery and design software tools ranging from simple Microsoft Visio scripts to full
                        blown web applications.

                        I fulfilled two positions while working for InfoPro Corporation. The first was as an Instructor
                        at the Navy's Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) school. This was an extremely rewarding position
                        because I knew the knowledge I was imparting on the troops could not only save their lives but
                        also allow them to save others. The second position was as an Unexploded Ordnance (UXO)
                        technician on Eglin Air Force Base. Here I assisted and supported testing of most new explosive
                        weaponry that our troops would use world wide. The weaponry testing was extremely diverse
                        ranging anywhere from testing propellant composition of small arms ammunition, conducting new
                        explosive characteristics testing, to connecting a few dozen rockets to a 2000 pound bomb and
                        sending it through simulated buildings and bunkers to optimize warhead performance.

                        I joined the United States Army fresh out of high school. I was extremely fortunate to be
                        selected for the prestigious Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) career. This career included a
                        year of training where I learned how to identify, render safe, and disposal of nuclear,
                        biological, and conventional munitions ranging from hand grenades, guided-missiles, and even
                        Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). The missions after training included supporting range
                        operations, supporting local bomb squads, protecting both United States and foreign dignitaries,
                        and deploying to combat zones around the world.
