                        Hello, my name is Curtis Smith and I am extremely excited to be transitioning into the software
                        engineering field. I completed my Bachelor's in Software Engineering from Arizona State
                        University in August of 2020 and can't wait to start applying the skills I have developed in my
                        new career. My wife, two little boys, and I currently reside in Alpharetta, Georgia. We really
                        love this area of North Georgia because we grew up near here and have really enjoyed watching
                        this area grow in size each year with more and more sources of entertainment around us. Since
                        we lived in Florida for several years while my wife was earning her Bachelor's Degree and I was
                        working in a different field, we are also really enjoying being back around our families again.
                        To say I enjoyed and prided myself in my old career field would be an understatement. For that
                        last 15+ years I have had the honor of being an expert in explosives. It started with my time
                        in Army as a member of the Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) field. Then transitioned into me
                        being an instructor for both the Army's and Navy's EOD schools. And finally as a technician on
                        Eglin Air Force Base supporting research and development of Next Generation Warheads.
                        Unfortunately, that job did come with some inherent risks that were counter productive to being
                        a family man as well as an expert in explosives. So I decided that I wanted something safer but
                        still wanted to be on the cutting edge of technologies, which ultimately lead me to software
                        engineering.
